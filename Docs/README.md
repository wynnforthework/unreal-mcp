# Unreal Engine MCP Documentation

Welcome to the documentation for the Unreal Engine Model Context Protocol (MCP) integration. This documentation will help you understand, set up, and use the MCP system with Unreal Engine through natural language commands with AI assistants.

## Overview

The Unreal MCP system provides powerful tools for controlling Unreal Engine through natural language commands. Instead of learning complex editor interfaces, you can simply describe what you want to accomplish and let the AI assistant handle the technical implementation.

## Documentation Sections

### Core Tools Documentation

- **[Blueprint Tools](Blueprint-Tools.md)** - Create and manage Blueprint classes, components, variables, physics, and compilation
- **[Blueprint Action Tools](Blueprint-Action-Tools.md)** - Dynamically discover available Blueprint actions and create nodes using Unreal's action database
- **[Editor Tools](Editor-Tools.md)** - Control the Unreal Engine editor, manage actors, transforms, and scene objects  
- **[Node Tools](Node-Tools.md)** - Build Blueprint visual scripting logic, event nodes, and node connections
- **[UMG Tools](UMG-Tools.md)** - Create user interfaces, widgets, layouts, and interactive UI elements
- **[DataTable Tools](DataTable-Tools.md)** - Manage structured game data, create tables, and perform CRUD operations
- **[Project Tools](Project-Tools.md)** - Organize projects, manage input systems, create structs, and handle project structure

### Additional Resources

- **[Tools](Tools/README.md)** - Technical implementation details and tool references

## Getting Started

1. **Choose Your Focus Area**: Start with the documentation section that matches your immediate needs
2. **Use Natural Language**: All examples show how to request functionality using plain English
3. **Follow the Patterns**: Each section includes progressive examples from basic to advanced usage
4. **Combine Tools**: Many workflows use multiple tool categories together for complete functionality

## Key Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Control Unreal Engine using conversational commands
- **Comprehensive Coverage**: Tools for all major Unreal Engine systems and workflows
- **Progressive Examples**: From simple tasks to complex game development scenarios
- **Best Practices**: Recommended approaches and common patterns
- **Error Handling**: Troubleshooting guides and common solutions

## Example Workflows

**Creating a Complete Character**: Use Blueprint Tools to create the character class, Editor Tools to spawn instances, Node Tools to add behavior logic, and UMG Tools for health bars.

**Building Game Data**: Use Project Tools to create structs, DataTable Tools to manage item/character data, and Blueprint Tools to reference that data in gameplay systems.

**Setting Up UI Systems**: Use UMG Tools to create interfaces, Node Tools to connect UI events to gameplay, and Project Tools to organize input actions.

Each documentation section provides detailed examples and patterns for these integrated workflows.
