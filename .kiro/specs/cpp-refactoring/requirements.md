# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The UnrealMCP plugin contains several large C++ command handler files (1800+ lines) that have grown organically and now suffer from maintainability issues. These files handle multiple responsibilities including blueprint creation, component management, property setting, and various Unreal Engine integrations. The codebase needs systematic refactoring to improve maintainability, readability, and extensibility while preserving all existing functionality.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1: Code Structure and Organization

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the UnrealMCP codebase, I want the large command handler classes to be broken down into smaller, focused components, so that I can easily understand, modify, and extend specific functionality without affecting unrelated code.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a command handler file exceeds 500 lines THEN it SHALL be split into multiple focused classes
2. WHEN related functionality is grouped together THEN it SHALL be organized into logical service classes
3. WHEN a class has multiple responsibilities THEN it SHALL be refactored to follow Single Responsibility Principle
4. WHEN common patterns are repeated THEN they SHALL be extracted into reusable base classes or utilities

### Requirement 2: Command Pattern Implementation

**User Story:** As a developer extending the MCP functionality, I want a consistent command pattern implementation, so that adding new commands follows a predictable structure and reduces code duplication.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a new command is added THEN it SHALL follow a standardized command interface
2. WHEN command validation occurs THEN it SHALL use a common validation framework
3. WHEN command execution happens THEN it SHALL use consistent error handling patterns
4. WHEN command responses are generated THEN they SHALL follow a unified response format

### Requirement 3: Factory Pattern for Component Creation

**User Story:** As a developer working with Unreal Engine components, I want a factory system for creating different component types, so that component creation logic is centralized and easily extensible.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating Blueprint components THEN the system SHALL use a component factory
2. WHEN adding new component types THEN they SHALL be registered with the factory
3. WHEN component creation fails THEN it SHALL provide clear error messages with available alternatives
4. WHEN component properties are set THEN it SHALL use type-safe property setters

### Requirement 4: Service Layer Architecture

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining business logic, I want core functionality separated into service classes, so that the command handlers focus only on request/response handling while services handle the actual work.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Blueprint operations are performed THEN they SHALL be handled by a BlueprintService
2. WHEN component operations are performed THEN they SHALL be handled by a ComponentService
3. WHEN property operations are performed THEN they SHALL be handled by a PropertyService
4. WHEN validation is needed THEN it SHALL be handled by dedicated validation services

### Requirement 5: Error Handling and Logging

**User Story:** As a developer debugging issues, I want consistent error handling and comprehensive logging, so that I can quickly identify and resolve problems in the MCP integration.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN errors occur THEN they SHALL be logged with appropriate severity levels
2. WHEN operations fail THEN they SHALL return structured error responses
3. WHEN debugging is needed THEN detailed operation logs SHALL be available
4. WHEN exceptions are thrown THEN they SHALL be caught and converted to proper error responses

### Requirement 6: Performance Optimization

**User Story:** As a user of the MCP system, I want operations to execute efficiently, so that the integration doesn't impact Unreal Engine's performance.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN Blueprint lookups occur THEN they SHALL use caching where appropriate
2. WHEN repeated operations happen THEN expensive computations SHALL be memoized
3. WHEN large data structures are processed THEN they SHALL use efficient algorithms
4. WHEN memory allocations occur THEN they SHALL be minimized and properly managed

### Requirement 7: Type Safety and Validation

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP API, I want strong type safety and input validation, so that invalid operations are caught early with clear error messages.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN JSON parameters are processed THEN they SHALL be validated against expected schemas
2. WHEN type conversions occur THEN they SHALL be safe and provide clear error messages
3. WHEN required parameters are missing THEN the system SHALL return descriptive validation errors
4. WHEN invalid values are provided THEN the system SHALL suggest valid alternatives

### Requirement 8: Documentation and Code Clarity

**User Story:** As a new developer joining the project, I want well-documented and self-explanatory code, so that I can quickly understand the system architecture and contribute effectively.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN classes are created THEN they SHALL have clear documentation explaining their purpose
2. WHEN complex algorithms are implemented THEN they SHALL include explanatory comments
3. WHEN public interfaces are defined THEN they SHALL have comprehensive API documentation
4. WHEN design patterns are used THEN they SHALL be clearly identified and explained

### Requirement 9: Testability and Modularity

**User Story:** As a developer ensuring code quality, I want the refactored code to be easily testable, so that I can write comprehensive unit tests and maintain high code coverage.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN services are created THEN they SHALL have mockable interfaces
2. WHEN dependencies are used THEN they SHALL be injected rather than hard-coded
3. WHEN business logic is implemented THEN it SHALL be separated from Unreal Engine dependencies where possible
4. WHEN complex operations are performed THEN they SHALL be broken into testable units

### Requirement 10: Backward Compatibility

**User Story:** As a user of the existing MCP system, I want all current functionality to continue working after refactoring, so that my existing integrations are not broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN refactoring is complete THEN all existing MCP commands SHALL continue to work
2. WHEN API responses are generated THEN they SHALL maintain the same format
3. WHEN error conditions occur THEN they SHALL produce equivalent error messages
4. WHEN performance is measured THEN it SHALL be equal to or better than the current implementation
