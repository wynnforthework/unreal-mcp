# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The current MCP tools for creating custom Blueprint functions (`create_custom_blueprint_function` and `set_text_block_widget_component_binding`) generate functions that cannot be properly edited in the Unreal Engine Blueprint graph editor. Users cannot modify function descriptions, access specifiers (public/private), categories, or other metadata that should be available for user-defined functions. This limits the usability and maintainability of generated Blueprint functions.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a Blueprint developer, I want custom functions created by MCP tools to be fully editable in the Blueprint graph, so that I can modify their properties, descriptions, and visibility settings just like manually created functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom function is created via MCP tools THEN the function SHALL appear in the Blueprint editor's Functions list with full editing capabilities
2. WHEN I right-click on a custom function in the Blueprint editor THEN I SHALL be able to access the function's properties dialog
3. WHEN I open the function properties dialog THEN I SHALL be able to edit the function description, category, access specifier, and other metadata
4. WHEN I modify function properties in the Blueprint editor THEN the changes SHALL persist after Blueprint compilation and saving

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a Blueprint developer, I want to set function descriptions and categories when creating functions via MCP tools, so that my generated functions are properly documented and organized.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating a custom function via MCP tools THEN I SHALL be able to specify a description parameter
2. WHEN creating a custom function via MCP tools THEN I SHALL be able to specify a category parameter  
3. WHEN creating a custom function via MCP tools THEN I SHALL be able to specify an access specifier (Public, Protected, Private)
4. WHEN a function is created with metadata THEN the metadata SHALL be visible in the Blueprint editor immediately
5. WHEN a function is created with metadata THEN the metadata SHALL be preserved during Blueprint compilation

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a Blueprint developer, I want custom functions to follow Unreal Engine's standard function creation patterns, so that they behave identically to manually created functions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a custom function is created THEN it SHALL use the same UE API patterns as the Blueprint editor's "Add Function" feature
2. WHEN a custom function is created THEN it SHALL have proper function signature metadata stored in the Blueprint
3. WHEN a custom function is created THEN it SHALL support all standard function properties (Pure, Const, CallInEditor, etc.)
4. WHEN a custom function is created THEN it SHALL be compatible with Blueprint inheritance and interface implementation

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer using the MCP tools, I want existing custom function creation to continue working while gaining the new editing capabilities, so that no existing functionality is broken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN existing MCP function creation calls are made THEN they SHALL continue to work without modification
2. WHEN new optional parameters are added THEN they SHALL have sensible defaults
3. WHEN a function is created without metadata parameters THEN it SHALL still be fully editable in the Blueprint editor
4. WHEN the fix is applied THEN all existing generated functions SHALL become editable (if technically feasible)
