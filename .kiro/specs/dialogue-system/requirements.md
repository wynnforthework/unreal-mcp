# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature implements a comprehensive dialogue system for Unreal Engine that enables interactive conversations between the player character and NPCs. The system will provide a flexible framework for creating branching dialogues with multiple response options, while integrating seamlessly with the existing Third Person Character Blueprint. The dialogue system will include both the core functionality and a working demonstration with an NPC character.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a player, I want to initiate conversations with NPCs by approaching them and pressing an interaction key, so that I can engage in meaningful dialogue exchanges.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the player character is within interaction range of an NPC THEN the system SHALL display an interaction prompt
2. WHEN the player presses the interaction key while in range THEN the system SHALL start the dialogue sequence
3. WHEN the player moves out of interaction range THEN the system SHALL hide the interaction prompt
4. IF no dialogue is assigned to the NPC THEN the system SHALL display a default message

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a player, I want to see dialogue text and response options in a clear UI interface, so that I can read conversations and make choices easily.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dialogue starts THEN the system SHALL display a dialogue UI with NPC text
2. WHEN dialogue options are available THEN the system SHALL show numbered response choices
3. WHEN the player selects a response THEN the system SHALL advance to the corresponding dialogue node
4. WHEN a dialogue ends THEN the system SHALL close the dialogue UI and return control to the player

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to create dialogue content using DataTables, so that I can easily manage and modify conversations without code changes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN creating dialogue content THEN the system SHALL use a DataTable structure for dialogue nodes
2. WHEN defining dialogue nodes THEN each node SHALL contain speaker text, response options, and next node references
3. WHEN referencing other nodes THEN the system SHALL support branching dialogue paths
4. IF a dialogue node has no responses THEN the system SHALL treat it as a conversation ending

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want NPCs to have configurable dialogue assignments, so that different characters can have unique conversations.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up an NPC THEN the system SHALL allow assignment of a dialogue DataTable
2. WHEN an NPC has multiple dialogue options THEN the system SHALL support conditional dialogue selection
3. WHEN an NPC is interacted with THEN the system SHALL load the appropriate dialogue content
4. IF an NPC has no dialogue assigned THEN the system SHALL use a fallback dialogue

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a player, I want the dialogue system to pause gameplay during conversations, so that I can focus on the dialogue without distractions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a dialogue starts THEN the system SHALL disable player movement and camera controls
2. WHEN a dialogue is active THEN the system SHALL show the mouse cursor for UI interaction
3. WHEN a dialogue ends THEN the system SHALL restore normal gameplay controls
4. WHEN a dialogue is active THEN the system SHALL prevent other game interactions

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want a working example with the Third Person Character, so that I can see the dialogue system in action and understand implementation patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the example is set up THEN the system SHALL include a configured NPC Blueprint with dialogue
2. WHEN using the Third Person Character THEN the system SHALL integrate interaction capabilities
3. WHEN testing the example THEN the player SHALL be able to have a complete conversation with the NPC
4. WHEN examining the example THEN all components SHALL be properly documented and reusable
