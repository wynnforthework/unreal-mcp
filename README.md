This project enables AI assistant clients like Cursor, Windsurf and Claude Desktop to control Unreal Engine through natural language using the Model Context Protocol (MCP).

## ⚠️ Experimental Status

This project is currently in an **EXPERIMENTAL** state. The API, functionality, and implementation details are subject to significant changes. While we encourage testing and feedback, please be aware that:

- Breaking changes may occur without notice
- Features may be incomplete or unstable
- Documentation may be outdated or missing
- Production use is not recommended at this time

## 🌟 Overview

The Unreal MCP integration provides comprehensive tools for controlling Unreal Engine through natural language:

| Category | Capabilities |
|----------|-------------|
| **Actor Management** | • Create and delete actors (cubes, spheres, lights, cameras, etc.)<br>• Set actor transforms (position, rotation, scale)<br>• Query actor properties and find actors by name<br>• List all actors in the current level |
| **Blueprint Development** | • Create new Blueprint classes with custom parent classes (Actor, Pawn, etc.)<br>• Add and configure components (StaticMesh, Camera, Light, etc.)<br>• Set component properties and static mesh assets<br>• Configure physics properties (simulation, gravity, mass, damping)<br>• Set Pawn-specific properties (auto possess, rotation control)<br>• Compile Blueprints and spawn Blueprint actors with custom transforms<br>• Create project-wide input mappings for player controls |
| **Blueprint Node Graph** | • Add event nodes for standard events (BeginPlay, Tick) and input actions<br>• Create function call nodes with target components and parameters<br>• Connect nodes with proper pin linkages for execution and data flow<br>• Add variables with various types (Boolean, Integer, Float, Vector, etc.)<br>• Create component references and self references in the graph<br>• Find and identify nodes in the Blueprint graph by type/event<br>• Build complete gameplay logic chains through the Blueprint visual scripting system |
| **UMG/UI Development** | • Create UMG Widget Blueprints for building user interfaces<br>• Add and customize UI components (text, buttons, images, checkboxes, sliders, etc.)<br>• Create complex layouts with scrollboxes, borders, and containers<br>• Set up event bindings and property bindings for dynamic UI<br>• Add widgets to the viewport with z-ordering control |
| **Project Management** | • Create and organize content browser folders for asset management<br>• Create project folders for non-content files (logs, intermediate, etc.)<br>• Set up input mappings for keyboard, mouse and gamepad controls<br>• Configure project-wide settings for game development |
| **Editor Control** | • Focus viewport on specific actors or locations with custom distance<br>• Control viewport camera orientation with precise angle settings<br>• Find actors in the scene using name pattern matching and wildcards<br>• Access and modify actor properties through the editor interface<br>• Create and configure different light types (Point, Spot, Directional)<br>• Adjust light properties (intensity, color, attenuation, shadows, source size) |

All these capabilities are accessible through natural language commands via AI assistants, making it easy to automate and control Unreal Engine workflows.

## 🧩 Components

### Sample Project (MCPGameProject) `MCPGameProject`
- Based off the Blank Project, but with the UnrealMCP plugin added.

### Plugin (UnrealMCP) `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP`
- Native TCP server for MCP communication
- Integrates with Unreal Editor subsystems
- Implements actor manipulation tools
- Handles command execution and response handling

### Python MCP Server `Python/unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Implemented in `unreal_mcp_server.py`
- Manages TCP socket connections to the C++ plugin (port 55557)
- Handles command serialization and response parsing
- Provides error handling and connection management
- Loads and registers tool modules from the `tools` directory
- Uses the FastMCP library to implement the Model Context Protocol

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.5+
- Python 3.12+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)

### Sample project

For getting started quickly, feel free to use the starter project in `MCPGameProject`. This is a UE 5.5 Blank Starter Project with the `UnrealMCP.uplugin` already configured. 

1. **Prepare the project**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
2. **Build the project (including the plugin)**
   - Open solution (`.sln`)
   - Choose `Development Editor` as your target.
   - Build

### Plugin
Otherwise, if you want to use the plugin in your existing project:

1. **Copy the plugin to your project**
   - Copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP` to your project's Plugins folder

2. **Enable the plugin**
   - Edit > Plugins
   - Find "UnrealMCP" in Editor category
   - Enable the plugin
   - Restart editor when prompted

3. **Build the plugin**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
   - Open solution (`.sln)
   - Build with your target platform and output settings

### Python Server Setup

See [Python/README.md](Python/README.md) for detailed Python setup instructions, including:
- Setting up your Python environment
- Running the MCP server
- Using direct or server-based connections

### Configuring your MCP Client

Use the following JSON for your mcp configuration based on your MCP client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "unrealMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "<path/to/the/folder/PYTHON>",
        "run",
        "unreal_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    }
  }
}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.
