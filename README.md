## 🧩 Components

### Sample Project (MCPGameProject) `MCPGameProject`
- Based off the Blank Project, but with the UnrealMCP plugin added.

### Plugin (UnrealMCP) `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP`
- Native TCP server for MCP communication
- Integrates with Unreal Editor subsystems
- Implements actor manipulation tools
- Handles command execution and response handling

### Python MCP Servers
- 7 different mcp servers, stored in Python/*_tools/
- Manages TCP socket connections to the C++ plugin (port 55557)
- Handles command serialization and response parsing
- Provides error handling and connection management
- Loads and registers tool modules from the `tools` directory
- Uses the FastMCP library to implement the Model Context Protocol

## 🚀 Quick Start Guide

### Prerequisites
- Unreal Engine 5.6
- Python 3.12+
- MCP Client (e.g., Claude Desktop, Cursor, Windsurf)

### Sample project

For getting started quickly, feel free to use the starter project in `MCPGameProject`. This is a UE 5.6 Blank Starter Project with the `UnrealMCP.uplugin` already configured. 

1. **Prepare the project**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
2. **Build the project (including the plugin)**
   - Open solution (`.sln`)
   - Choose `Development Editor` as your target.
   - Build

### Plugin
Otherwise, if you want to use the plugin in your existing project:

1. **Copy the plugin to your project**
   - Copy `MCPGameProject/Plugins/UnrealMCP` to your project's Plugins folder

2. **Enable the plugin**
   - Edit > Plugins
   - Find "UnrealMCP" in Editor category
   - Enable the plugin
   - Restart editor when prompted

3. **Build the plugin**
   - Right-click your .uproject file
   - Generate Visual Studio project files
   - Open solution (`.sln)
   - Build with your target platform and output settings

### Python Server Setup

}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.
