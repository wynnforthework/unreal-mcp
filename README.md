### Configuring your MCP Client

Use the following JSON for your mcp configuration based on your MCP client.

```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "blueprintMCP": {
      "command": "uv",
      "args": [
        "--directory",
        "E:\\code\\unreal-mcp\\Python",
        "run",
        "blueprint_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    },
    "editorMCP": {

        "project_mcp_server.py"
      ]
    },
    "blueprintActionMCP": {
      "command": "uv",

}
```

An example is found in `mcp.json`

### MCP Configuration Locations

Depending on which MCP client you're using, the configuration file location will differ:

| MCP Client | Configuration File Location | Notes |
|------------|------------------------------|-------|
| Claude Desktop | `~/.config/claude-desktop/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\claude-desktop\mcp.json` |
| Cursor | `.cursor/mcp.json` | Located in your project root directory |
| Windsurf | `~/.config/windsurf/mcp.json` | On Windows: `%USERPROFILE%\.config\windsurf\mcp.json` |

Each client uses the same JSON format as shown in the example above. 
Simply place the configuration in the appropriate location for your MCP client.
